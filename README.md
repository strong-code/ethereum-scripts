# ethereum-scripts

This is a collection of 1-off scripts that relate to ethereum research

# TODO

1. Define contract for producer (script) and consumer (most likely an SQS backed runner)
2. Define infrastructure
3. Break this out into something intelligible at some point.

# Ideas
- Number of ethereum/blockchain related job postings
- Naive bayes sentiment analysis (twitter, blogs)
- MS Azure blockchain announcements/development/adoption
- Volume, market cap, sell/buy order numbers by week
- Google trends activity/mentions
- Specifically mentions of big bank and blockchain/ethereum integrations (ConsenSys, R3CEV)
