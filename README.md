# ethereum-scripts

This is a collection of 1-off scripts that relate to ethereum research

# TODO

1. Define contract for producer (script) and consumer (most likely cron)
2. Define infrastructure/design
  - Add graph/histogram for data, presented as either email or (more likely) web page on server for all reported data
  - cron scripts that run on server, add logging for all sources
3. Break this out into something intelligible at some point.
